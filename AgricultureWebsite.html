    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary role of agriculture research is to heighten knowledge and improve technology.it heightens understanding of the interactions and interdependence between production systems and farming communities</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Agriculture is the <a href="">art</a> and<a href="">science</a> of cultivating the soil,growing crops and raising livestock.It includes the preparationof plant and animal productsfor people to use and their distribution to markets.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Youth are not attracted to the profession as there is neither guarantee of income nor enough intitutions that provide jobs.At present,only few crops get a Minimun support price(MSP)guarantee from the government.This has created a vicitious <a href="">How to insipire india's youth to take up farmers?</a></p>

        <h1>Organic Farming</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic farming also known as ecological farming or biological farming is an agriculture system that uses fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure,green,bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting </p>
        <p>Farmers who focus on sustaining the environment believe that a successful organic system begin with a healthy soil that fasters healthy plants,livestock,and people.Despite the  higher costs of labour and relstively moderate yeilds. 1.7% of candaian farms were certified organic in 2009.</p>

            What are the examples of conventional agriculture farming,also known as traditional farming or industrial agriculture,refers to farming systems which include the use of synthetic chemical fertilizers,pesticides,herbicides and other continuous inputs,generally modified organisms concentrated animal feeding operations heavy irrigations intensive methods.

        <h3><u>Traditional crop modification</u></h3>
        <p>Traditional methods of modifying plants,like selective breeding and crossbreeding,have been around for nearly 10,000 years.Most of the foods we eat today were originally created using a combination of traditional methods.</p>
        <span><h3><u>Generic Engineering</u></h3></span><p>Generic engineering is a method that,among other things enables scientists to copy a gene with a desired in one organism and out it into another.Genetic engineering has been used since the 1970s and builds on the scientific advances we have made in the study of DNA.</p> 
        <h3><u>Genome Editing</u></h3><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genome editing is a new method chat gives scientists more precise and targeted ways to develop new crop varities.Genomic editing tools can easier and quicker to make changes that were previously done through traditional breeding.</p>
